#Hi Everyone

Smart Agriculture System:

Pre-requisites:
	1. NodeMCU (ESP8266)
	2. DHT11
	3. Soil moisture sensor
	4. Some basic coding skills

About the project:
	1. In this project, we are reading temperature & humidity and pushing values to the remote client.
	2. We are measureing soil moisture using soil moisture sensor. When the water/soil moist is below the
		specified level, it automatically opens the solenoid valve and supplies water.
	3. In addition to that we can control the valve(On/Off) from remote location.
